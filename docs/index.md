## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with bash and R
- Basic molecular biology knowledge preferred (gene expression and regulation)
- HPC knowledge preferred

- - -

## Learning objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants should be able to:

!!! quote ""

    - explain the concept of modelling and simulations, and how simulations can help answer research questions;
    - briefly describe the main steps of gene expression, and explain what is a Gene Regulatory Network;
    - list several classes of GRN models;
    - generate a small random GRN with the sismonr package and simulate the expression of its gene;
    - submit and manage jobs on a cluster using a scheduler and use software through environment modules;
    - automate a large number of tasks on a HPC using array jobs.

## Some of the things we won't cover in this workshop ðŸ™…

- How to : 
    - construct a mathematical or statistical model for a specific biological system of interest;
    - estimate model parameters based on experimental data;
    - reconstruct a GRN from experimental data;
- Any questions we don't have an answer for ðŸ¤¦
